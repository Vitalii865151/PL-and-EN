Inside a Cozy Room
Hello, how are you? Good morning. What's your name?
In a private house, there is a room with a floor and a ceiling. The wallpaper decorates the walls. You looked left and right - on the left, a wardrobe stands, and there are toys on it. Various stuff is scattered around.
A laptop is on the table, along with a mouse pad and a mouse. An armchair invites you to sit, and a bed with pillows and a blanket looks very comfortable. A window with a curtain lets light into the room.
A small table holds a TV, while an old cupboard adds charm. A barbell for training rests in the corner. In the middle of the ceiling hangs a chandelier.
There is something interesting here. What's there? Tell about it. What are they writing?
